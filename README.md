## Game Overview <a name="game-overview"></a>

**Invaders From Space** features a classic space shooter gameplay with modern twists. Here's what you can expect:

- **Player Spaceship:** Take control of a powerful player spaceship with a health bar and three lives. Your goal is to defeat the alien invaders and protect Earth.

- **Alien Enemies:** Face off against various alien enemies, each with its own unique behaviors and attack patterns. Aliens come in different sets and appear randomly.

- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
  - Shoot alien enemies with your spaceship's bullets using the spacebar (or left mouse click).
  - Defend against enemy bullets and protect your spaceship with three available shields.
  - Watch your health bar carefully. Damage from enemy bullets reduces your health, and after five hits, you'll lose one life.
  - Collect coins, health packs, and life boosts dropped by aliens for power-ups.

- **Mother Ship:** Keep an eye out for the formidable Mother Ship that occasionally passes at the top of the screen. Destroying it earns you extra points.

- **Wave System:** Survive wave after wave of alien invasions. The game tracks your progress through different waves.

- **User Interface:** The game features a comprehensive UI panel that displays your health, remaining lives, score, high score, collected coins, and current wave.
